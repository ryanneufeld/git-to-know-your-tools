Abed and Brita are working on a project together
- using Dropbox to share their working files with eachother
- in constant communication to keep from stepping on eachothers toes they are
    + "Hey Abed, I'm going to edit the config file. I'll let you know when I'm done."

- Time goes on, and for a while this works.
- Occasionally someone forgets to warn the other that they were working on a file
    + Sometimes they can choose one of the conflicted versions
    + Other times they stomp on eachothers changes

- The project gets big enough and they bring in Chang to help them.
- Now they have serious problems, Chang forgets (due to his diagnosed Changnesia) to tell anyone what he's doing, ever.
    + Now they're in a real mess, conflicted versions everywhere
    + Restoring from dropbox backups
- Reverting changes means restoring an old version, or knowing exactly what lines changed.


This is clearly a mess.

One day the Dean is walking by and hears Abed and Brita arguing about who's fault it was to give Chang access to the source code. "It sounds like you need version control, you should checkout that git thingy I hear the IT guys talking about."

- Pros and cons
    + Web ui isn't terrible, but isn't great for finding the right version of your file.
    + Dropbox lets them get back older versions of files, or deleted files.
    + Files that are conflicted have to be manually merged
        * No changelog, no way to know which file is canonical
    + Forgetful colleagues may not tell you when their done with a file.
