## Setting up your editor


# git init

# Three trees (areas or lists):
- Working
    + This is your copy of the code. This is what you edit.
- Stage
    + This is where your changes go when you `git add` them.
- Index
    + This is where your changes go when you `git commit`.

# git add
- Add changes from Working tree, to the stage tree.
## git add -p
- Add partial files to from the working tree to the stage tree.

# git commit
- Add changes in the stage tree to the index.

# git log
## git 

# git reset
## --hard

# git checkout
## git checkout -b
## git branch



# Notes:
- Provide any needed configs rather than have them type them out.
